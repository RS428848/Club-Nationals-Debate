Contention 1: Hate Speech is harmful with serious consequences
We are deluding ourselves from the problem if we do not see the parallel connection between intolerant or hateful rhetoric and its inevitable consequences such as mental health, suicide, and increase in crime. One of the many minorities that are victims of hate speech are Muslims. According to The Daily Beast, after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, official statistics show that hate speech and hate crimes against Muslims are at their highest levels since 2001. A study done by the FBI in 2012  indicates that in a one-year period, from 2009 to 2010, there was a staggering 42 percent increase in hate crimes against Muslims in this country. Similarly, other incidents such as anti-Semitic harassment, and assault climbed 86% in the first quarter of 2017 when compared with the first quarter of 2016.
Multiple researches suggest that these increases are connected to the rising profile of white nationalism in politics and the media or in other words, a rise in hate speech.Another incident where hate speech has directly led to crime is the shooting rampage at Sikh Gurdwara, a house of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The shooter, Wade Michael Page was a member of Hammerskin Nation, one of the most violent white supremacist groups in the country. Being apart of this organization, Page was taught radical teachings and hate speeches which prompted him to commit such massacre. If we had punished those who gave hate speeches such as the Hammerskin Nation, young people such as Page would not have been able to commit such massacre so easily. Furthermore, the damage that hate crimes do extends beyond those individual victims. It impacts the whole group and community. According to Every Town Research, after a violent hate crime incident, members of the same targeted group will be affected greatly. Besides the small changes due to protective measures such as not going to certain areas or avoiding going out, these people will also experience severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress. They are scared and lost on what will happen to them in them in the future. In Boston, researchers found that  LGBT adolescents who lived in neighborhoods with higher rates of LGBT assault hate crimes were significantly more likely to consider or attempt suicide than those in neighborhoods with lower hate crime rates. Suicide is a huge issue that has to be 
Contention 2: There are already restrictions and boundaries on free speech

Notes:

Instead of punishing hate speeches, how about creating stricter gun laws. This would cause an argument with the right to bear arms.
